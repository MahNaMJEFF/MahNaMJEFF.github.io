    <h2>Tricks</h2>
    <p>We will mainly be focusing on 3 tricks, the kickflip, the pop shuvit and the frontside 180. I will try to explain how the trick is done, what tricks it builds off of and what tricks they build into.</p>
    <p>I will also try to explain the history of the trick and show some exaples of professionals doing it. Hopefully this is helpfull and you can use it to get better at Skateboarding<p>

    <h2>History of Skateboarding</h2>
    <p>The history of skateboarding first started around the 1950s when kids would attach their roller skate wheels to a wooden plank and would ride it around. By the 70s it started to take off and skateboard companies started appearing and making the things that make up a skateboard. The deck, wheels, trucks and bearings. The first skateparks also opened in california so skaters would have a designated place to skate. In the 1990s vert skating (the skating that is done on a huge half pipe) became popular and new tricks were being developed, one that involved a flip, thats what leads us to our next page</p>
