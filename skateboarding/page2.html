    <h2>What is needed to pop shuvit</h2>
    <p>This trick isnt too hard to get down but some other tricks to know are a shuvit where you dont pop the tail. Just know how to pop the tail hard enough so a good ollie could also help to. You only need to use your back foot with this trick so its god for begginers</p>
    <p>Step 1: have your back foot slightly below the pocket of the tail
    step 2: (optional) have your front foot at a slight angle by the bolts, this just helps get your front foot out of the way
    Step 3: scoop the tail and jump
    Step 4: wait for the rotation and land
    step 5:?????
    step 6: profit!</p>
